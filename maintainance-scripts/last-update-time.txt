If have a bunch or markdown file under the folder "../docs/solidity-basic/". And each markdown file is started with some meta data surrounded by "---" like this :

```
---
title: fileTitle
last_update:

    date: lastUpdateDate

---
```

or like this:

```
---
title: fileTitle
last_update:
    date: lastUpdateDate

---
```


where `lastUpdateDate` is the last update date of the file. 

The formart of `lasteUpdateDate` is `YY/MM/DD` for example `2023-01-14`. 


Your mission is to write a python program that execute a `git` command to get the last modify time of each markdown file under the folder "../docs/solidity-basic/". And then you should update the `lasteUpdateDate` of each markdown file with the last modify time in the format `YY-MM-DD`. You should use regular expression by importing the `re` package.
