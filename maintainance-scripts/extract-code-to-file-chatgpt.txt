Write a python program that parse all markdown files under the path `../docs/solidity-basic/` and extract the code block between "```solidity" and "```" . Then save each one into a solidity file. You should complete the solidity file so that it's runable. The pragma is `pragma solidity ^0.8.17;`. 

All of the generated files should be under the directory `sample-code/dirname` where `dirname` is the same name as the markdown file name without `.md` suffix.


The format of the code block is like this:

{

:::tip tipTitle

```solidity
// code block
```

}


The code block is surrounded by "```solidity" and "```". If the "```solidity" and "```" pair is not surrounded by :::tip and ::: you don't need to extract them. 

The extracted code block need to be completed as a runnable contract similar to the following format:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract ExampleContract {
    // put code block here
}
```

The extracted code block should be put on the comment position: `// put code block here`. If the code block is already a contract, you don't need complete it. You should directly extract the code block and put into the solidity file.


After finding "```solidity" and "```" and the code block within it. You need to check whether it's surrounded by ":::tip tipTitle" and ":::". If yes, please use "tipTitle" as the name of the generated solidity tile.
